I think this code could be improved using cross validation to better
organize the test and train data and extract the model with the best performance to use.
In fact we could choose the most accurate test/train sample of data and use it to get the approximation.

Another way of improving the model is by collecting more Data to ensure the model is well trained and the error will be minimized.
